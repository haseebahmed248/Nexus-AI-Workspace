| 22     | TCP     | ALLOW  | Anywhere (SSH) |
| 80 (v6)  | TCP   | ALLOW  | Anywhere (IPv6) |
| 443 (v6) | TCP   | ALLOW  | Anywhere (IPv6) |
| 22 (v6)  | TCP   | ALLOW  | Anywhere (IPv6) |

### üîç Verify Service Logs  
To check real-time logs of the Nexus AI API Service, run:  
```bash
sudo journalctl -u nexus-api.service -f
```

## üìå Task 2: Nginx Installation & Log Analysis  

### ‚úÖ Installing & Starting Nginx  
The **Nginx** web server was successfully installed and enabled:  
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### üîé Checking Nginx Status  
To verify that Nginx is running, use:  
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### üìÇ Log File Directory  
The logs for Nginx are stored in:  
```bash
/var/log/nginx/access.log
/var/log/nginx/error.log
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Running Health Check  
To check if the **Nexus API** is running, execute:  
```bash
~/Nexus-AI-Workspace/scripts/health_check.sh
```
If the service is down, this script will restart it automatically.

### üìä Running Log Analysis  
To analyze Nginx logs and find the top request sources, run:  
```bash
~/Nexus-AI-Workspace/scripts/log_analysis.sh
```
Example Output:  
```
Analyzing log file: /var/log/nginx/access.log
Top 3 IP addresses with the most requests:
      1 127.0.0.1
      1 ::1
```

# Nginx Log Analysis - Task Completion

## **Task 2 Overview**
This guide covers the installation, configuration, and verification of Nginx, as well as running the log analysis script.

## **1. Installing and Starting Nginx**
Run the following command to install Nginx:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```
Enable and start the Nginx service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

## **2. Verifying Nginx Logs**
Check if log files exist:
```bash
ls -lah /var/log/nginx/
```
If logs are empty, ensure logging is enabled:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
Find and set:
```
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
```
Restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## **3. Generating Log Data**
Manually generate log entries:
```bash
curl -I http://localhost
curl -I http://127.0.0.1
```
Check logs:
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

## **4. Running Log Analysis Script**
Execute:
```bash
~/Nexus-AI-Workspace/scripts/log_analysis.sh
```
Expected output:
```
Analyzing log file: /var/log/nginx/access.log
Top 3 IP addresses with the most requests:
      1 127.0.0.1
      1 ::1
```

## **Task Completed Successfully ‚úÖ**
This confirms:
- Nginx is running
- Access logs are recorded
- Log analysis script works
